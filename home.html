                  its own water well. Today, shared public utilities give us
                  access to clean water by simply turning on the tap; cloud
                  computing works in a similar fashion. Just like water from the
                  tap in your kitchen, cloud computing services can be turned on
                  or off quickly as needed. Like at the water company, there is
                  a team of dedicated professionals making sure the service
                  provided is safe, secure, and available on a 24/7 basis. When
                  the tap isn’t on, not only are you saving water, but you
                  aren’t paying for resources you don’t currently need. &nbsp;

                  >The concept of cloud computing is proliferating throughout
                  the tech world now-a-day, and has become synonymous to the
                  internet itself, which is causing disruption to business as
                  usual for most in-house IT teams. This phenomenon has caught
                  the attention of more and more CIO’s across various
                  industries, and some find themselves sitting ducks, while
                  their competitors who got on the train earlier are reaping the
                  benefits of almost zero upfront cost and significantly reduced
                  overhead and/or administration. And today, many companies are
                  one way or another utilizing some form of cloud services,
                  whether it is web hosting with GoDaddy, offsite backup
                  repository with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Azure and
                  Office360 with Microsoft … they are all some form of cloud
                  solution, thus creating a new frontier for future business
                  opportunity.
